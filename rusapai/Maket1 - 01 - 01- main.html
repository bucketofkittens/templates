						<h1>GENERAL IDEA</h1>

We know Russian audience needs, attitudes and behavior like no others. We also know that the population of Russia Pacific and Siberia is much more adaptive for Asian brands  than the population of European part of Russia. We’ll help your brands, goods and services find their  consumers in Russia.</h2>

								<h6>Timenchuk Irina</h6>
								<i>Account director</i>
								<p>Although I was born in Vladivostok, my family moved to Rostov-On-Don when I was in elementary school. I returned after university and went on to work for a newspaper. While it was great fun, I didn't get the job satisfaction I'd hoped for. In 6 months I found my dream job at DV Region. If I have to work for most of my life, I'd at least like to believe in what I'm doing.</p>
