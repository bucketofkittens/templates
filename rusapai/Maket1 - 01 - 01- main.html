								<h6>Timenchuk Irina</h6>
								<i>Account director</i>
								<p>Although I was born in Vladivostok, my family moved to Rostov-On-Don when I was in elementary school. I returned after university and went on to work for a newspaper. While it was great fun, I didn't get the job satisfaction I'd hoped for. In 6 months I found my dream job at DV Region. If I have to work for most of my life, I'd at least like to believe in what I'm doing.</p>
